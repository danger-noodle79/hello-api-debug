# Hello API Debug

A tiny lab where Danger Noodle learns to read the runes of APIs.

## Why this exists
I’m moving into AI. APIs are the doors my models walk through. This repo is my first stone in the cathedral.

## Mini “API Debug” checklist
- [ ] Know HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Know status codes (200/400/401/403/404/500)
- [ ] Read JSON without crying
- [ ] Make a test request (e.g., https://httpbin.org/get)
